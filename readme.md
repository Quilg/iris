From all of the test and different training models we can make a conclusion. The accuary of the Iris database is very high (1) and using different models have showed us the same result. Classification report is also the same in all 3 cases. In the tests I have used random_state 120, but in the last one I have changed it to 40. Before changing, the result was the same, but with a lower state we see a change in the results, meaning that the test is less accurate.
